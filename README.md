# iconoclast

A little experiment in clojure/java interop borne out of curiosity of what would it take to add some features to deftype.

## Caveat emptor

It's still just a toy project. Also, gen-class, deftype or reify are probably enough for normal use-cases.

## Usage
Check test/iconoclast/test/utils/examples.clj for some examples.
